Todo4You
=========

Todo4You is an Android TODO App focused on making task management
as easy as possible. All common operations can be done form the main screen, including:

- Adding a TODO
- Finishing and canceling a TODO
- Scheduling and postponing a task
- Adding calendar entries

Todo4You reduces overhead by automating task management:

- Set a start date if you set a due date
- Highlights tasks that need attention, because they are due or can be started now.
- Helps to solve hard and unmaintained tasks, proposing to split the task, schedule it, delegating it, add calendar entries.

Requirements
============
A Caldav server that supports VTODO entries. Tested with Owncloud 8.

Status
======
This is a work in progress, currently targeted at developers. If you want to test it, you need to update `resources/accounts.properties` to match your calendar server parameters.
